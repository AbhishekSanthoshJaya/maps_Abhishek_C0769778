* User can add 4 markers on the map to denote a city
* Connected each city with a straight line of red colour and fill the area created by the quadrilateral with green colour (35% transparency)
* Beside each city add letters: A, B, C, and D were added
* Added thoroughfare, sub thoroughfare and postal code in the title
* Added city and province in the snippet
* When user taps on any of the lines, the distance between the two cities should be displayed beside each line
* When the user taps in the middle of the quadrilateral created by the lines, the total distance is displaed
* If the user applies a long press close by to the marker the application should removes the location from the map as well as the lines and quadrilateral
* Marker can be dragged and the address and label are updated along with the marker
